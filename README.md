"I spent the weekend bridging the gap between Embedded Systems and the Cloud! ☁️🚗

Just built a fully functional Vehicle Telemetry Pipeline using AWS IoT Core and Docker.

🔹 The Setup: A Python-based ECU simulator running in a Docker container. 🔹 The Logic: Real-time data transmission via MQTT to AWS. 🔹 The Result: Serverless triggers (Lambda) that monitor for 'Engine Overheating' and send instant alerts to my phone.

It’s exciting to see how tools like #Docker and #AWS are reshaping the way we validate and test automotive software.

Open to connecting with others in the #Automotive, #Embedded, and #CloudEngineering space!
